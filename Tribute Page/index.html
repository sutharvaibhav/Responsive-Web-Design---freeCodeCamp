        <ul style="margin-top: 30px; max-width: 550px">
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1933</span> - Leaves his family's
            farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression
            era program known as the "National Youth Administration"
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1935</span> - Has to stop school and
            save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps,
            helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said.
            "All of this left scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1937</span> - Finishes university
            and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69
            years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by
            Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who
            teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the
            military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead,
            the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to
            control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in
            Genetics and Plant Pathology

            <span style="font-weight: bold">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary
            increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to
            Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16
            years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent
            wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on
            Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1945</span> - Discovers a way to
            grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1953</span> - crosses a short,
            sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed,
            creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to
            provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and
            brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent
            in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding
            population

            <span style="font-weight: bold">1970</span> - receives the Nobel
            Peace Prize

          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1983</span> - helps seven African
            countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">1984</span> - becomes a
            distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">2005</span> - states "we will have
            to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically
            modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run
            out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous
            because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a
            long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting
            the best breeds."
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.
